<h1>Fielding Instructions for Youth Baseball Team</h1>
<h2>Before the Ball is Hit:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Evaluate potential force out opportunities. Focus on getting the lead force out to prevent runs.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Positioning:
    <ul>
      <li>Corners (1st and 3rd base) should be one step in front of the baseline, ready to take two steps and a dive towards the ball.</li>
      <li>Middle infielders (2nd base and shortstop) should be ready to move towards any ball on their side and cover second base when needed.</li>
      <li>Pitchers should move towards first or third base based on where the ball is hit to support fielding or back up bases.</li>
      <li>Catchers should prepare to clear the plate area and be ready for potential plays at home.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>After the Ball is Hit:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the ball is hit:
    <ul>
      <li>First and third basemen should guard their lines and prepare to charge balls hit towards them.</li>
      <li>Shortstops and second basemen must cover their halves and back each other up. The non-fielding middle infielder covers second base.</li>
      <li>Outfielders should immediately move to back up potential throws to bases, ensuring they position themselves behind the base that might be thrown to next.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Communication is key. Players should loudly call "I got it" or direct other players as needed to ensure clarity during plays.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Backup and coverage:
    <ul>
      <li>Every fielder not directly involved in a play should back up the nearest play or base.</li>
      <li>After an overthrow or missed catch, fielders need to be in positions to quickly retrieve the ball and prevent additional base advances by runners.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> End of play handling:
    <ul>
      <li>Throws should generally end up with the pitcher or catcher, depending on the situation and base runnersâ€™ positions.</li>
      <li>Focus on preventing runs over chasing outs between bases if there is a significant risk of allowing a score.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
