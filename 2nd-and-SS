<h1>Fielding Instructions for 2nd Base and Shortstop</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Cover your half of the infield. Do not cross an imaginary line from home plate through second base to the outfield fence.</li>
  <li><strong>Play Strategy:</strong> The non-fielding player covers second base. Be quick to support the other infielders by preparing to receive throws or cover bases.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Communicate loudly with teammates about who is fielding the ball and who is covering the base.</li>
  <li><strong>Backing Up:</strong> Always back up each other and be prepared to react to overthrows or missed catches.</li>
</ul>
