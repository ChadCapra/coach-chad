<h1>Fielding Instructions for Outfielders</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Stay alert and ready to move towards the ball whenever it is hit in your direction.</li>
  <li><strong>Play Strategy:</strong> Back up infield plays and be ready to cover large areas quickly to prevent the ball from getting past you.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Call out loudly ("I got it!") to claim fly balls and direct other outfielders to back up or cover bases.</li>
  <li><strong>Backing Up:</strong> Always position yourself to back up other outfielders and infield throws, anticipating where the play will develop.</li>
</ul>
