<h1>Fielding Instructions for Pitcher and Catcher</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pitcher Strategy:</strong> Cover or back up bases depending on where the ball is hit. Move towards first or third base accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Catcher Play:</strong> Clear the plate area and be ready for plays at home. Kick any obstructions like bats out of the way.</li>
  <li><strong>Positioning at Home:</strong> If there is a play at home and it's a force situation, keep one foot on home plate. If not, position yourself to make a tag play.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Both pitcher and catcher must communicate clearly with infielders about the status of the play and who is covering what base.</li>
</ul>
