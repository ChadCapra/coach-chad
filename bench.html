<h1>Youth Baseball Team Bench Protocol</h1>
<p>Follow these steps when on the bench during batting:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check the batting order. Know the three people in front of you and the person following you in the lineup.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move your magnet on the field diagram board to indicate your position for the next inning.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Batteries 1, 2, and 3 get their batting gear ready.
    <ul>
      <li>Batter 1 should move to the warm-up circle.</li>
      <li>Batter 2 should start warming up near the on-deck area.</li>
      <li>Batter 3 should be ready with their gear, waiting behind the fence, observing the pitches.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Batter 4 passes the scorebook to Batter 5, then prepares their batting gear and waits on the bench.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> During batting:
    <ul>
      <li>Batter 1 is in the batterâ€™s box.</li>
      <li>Batter 2 is in the on-deck circle.</li>
      <li>Batter 3 is behind the fence, watching and stretching.</li>
      <li>Batter 4 is at the end of the bench, ready to bat next.</li>
      <li>Batter 5 records the play outcomes in the scorebook during their turn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> All other players cheer on the team, without their batting gear on, unless they are the fourth batter in line.</li>
</ul>
