<h1>Fielding Instructions for 1st and 3rd Base</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> One step in front of the baseline to pinch the corners, ready to react quickly to balls hit towards you.</li>
  <li><strong>Range:</strong> Aim to cover the line with two steps and a dive, ensuring you can reach any ball hit directly up the line.</li>
  <li><strong>Play Strategy:</strong> Charge all balls hit within your range, especially those that are 10 to 15 feet up the baseline towards your base.</li>
  <li><strong>Backing Up:</strong> Prepare to back up plays at home or at your base, using momentum to make throws as needed.</li>
</ul>
